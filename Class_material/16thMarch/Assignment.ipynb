    "1.  Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how\n",
    "can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs very well on the training data but fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. It happens when the model becomes too complex and captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data as if they were genuine patterns. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequences of overfitting include low accuracy on new data, poor generalization, and high sensitivity to noise or outliers. Underfitting, on the other hand, leads to high bias and an inability to capture the complexity of the data, resulting in low accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, some approaches include reducing model complexity, increasing the size of the training dataset, using regularization techniques, or employing ensemble methods. Underfitting can be addressed by increasing model complexity, adding more relevant features, or using more sophisticated algorithms."

    "\n",
    "To reduce overfitting, some common approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization: Introducing a penalty term to the loss function to control the model's complexity, such as L1 or L2 regularization.\n",
    "- Cross-Validation: Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data.\n",
    "- Early Stopping: Monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance starts to degrade.\n",
    "- Feature Selection: Selecting only the most relevant features that contribute to the model's performance and discarding irrelevant or noisy features.\n",
    "- Data Augmentation: Increasing the size of the training dataset through techniques like data augmentation, which artificially generates additional training examples.\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) to leverage their collective knowledge and reduce overfitting."

    "- Bias: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. It represents the model's assumptions or biases about the relationship between the input features and the target labels.

It quantifies how much the model's predictions vary for different training data samples. High variance models are often overly complex and have high capacity. They can capture noise or random fluctuations in the training data, leading to overfitting. Such models have low error on the training data but perform poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

    "L2 Regularization (Ridge): It adds the squared values of the model's coefficients as a penalty term. It penalizes large coefficients and tends to distribute the impact of features more evenly.\n",

    "Elastic Net Regularization: It combines both L1 and L2 regularization by adding a linear combination of their penalty terms. It allows for a balance between feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage (L2).\n",

    "Dropout: It is a regularization technique specific to neural networks. It randomly sets a fraction of the input units or weights to zero during training, reducing the reliance on specific units and promoting generalization.\n",
    "\n",

By adding the penalty term, the model is encouraged to find a balance between fitting the training data well and not becoming too complex. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's performance on unseen data."
