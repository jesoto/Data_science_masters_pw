    "\n",
    "    The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which are variables that can only takes on a finite or countably infinite number of values. It defines the probabilitu of each possible value of the random varaible. The PMF gives the probability of observing a specific value, and it satisfies two properties: all probabilities are non negative and the sum of all probabilities is equal to 1.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lets consider a fair six sided die. The possible values that can ve obtained are 1,2,3,4,5,6 each with an equal probabilitu of 1/6. The PMF of this random variable would assign a probability of 1/6 ot each of these values, and the PMF would be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        PMF(1) = 1/6        \n",
    "        PMF(2) = 1/6\n",
    "        PMF(3) = 1/6\n",
    "        PMF(4) = 1/6\n",
    "        PMF(5) = 1/6\n",

    "- Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "\n",
    "    The PDF is used for continuous random variables, which are variables that can take on any value within a certain range. The PDF defines the probability distribution by specifying the likelihood of the random variable falling within a particular interval. Unlike the PMF, the PDF itself does not give the probability of a specific value since the probability of any single point in a continuous distribution is technically zero. Instead, the PDF represents the relative likelihood of different outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Let's consider the height of adult males in a population. The height is a continuous random variable that can take on any value within a range (e.g., between 150 cm and 200 cm). The PDF would describe the likelihood of observing different heights. For simplicity, let's assume that the distribution follows a normal distribution. The PDF would take the shape of a bell curve, with the highest point at the mean height.\n",

    "2. What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cumulative density function is a concept used in probability theory and statistics to describe the cumulative probabilitu distribution of a random varaible. It gives the probabilitu that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value.\n",

    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lets consider a fair six sided die. The CDF of this random variable would indicate the probability of obtaining a value less than or equal to a given value. For each possible value, the cdf qpuld increase by the probability associated with that value.\n",

    "- Why is CDF used?\n",
    "    The CDF is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Probability Calculation: The CDF allows us to calculate the probability of a random variable taking on a value less than or equal to a given value. This is particularly helpful in determining percentiles or quantiles of a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Distribution Comparison: The CDF can be used to compare different probability distributions. By comparing the CDFs of two random variables, we can assess which distribution has a higher probability of smaller or larger values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Random Variable Analysis: The CDF provides a comprehensive summary of the probability distribution of a random variable. It allows us to understand the overall behavior of the variable and analyze its characteristics, such as the median, quartiles, and range.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Random Variable Transformations: The CDF is also essential for transforming random variables. By applying the inverse of the CDF to a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 (known as a uniform random variable), we can generate random values that follow a desired probability distribution."
